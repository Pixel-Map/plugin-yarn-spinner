  This plugin adds support for Yarn Spinner dialog.  All dialog should be located directly under the main game directory
  within a folder named "dialog", all with an extension of ".yarn".

  Variables by default are prefixed by the name of the dialog file, meaning that each has it's own namespace (so one NPC
  can feel one way about a player vs. another NPC, without worrying about variable name conflicts).

  However, if a variable is prefixed with the "$global_", it will be stored globally, accessible by ALL NPCs.

  There's also some additional functionality built-in.  If you'd like to have a NPC become exhausted after a player
  speaks with them too many times, just increase the value of "$dialog_exhaustion".  If "$dialog_exhaustion" reaches 3,
  the plugin will automatically redirect to a node named "Exhausted" within the dialog file.

  Please note, if using ANY variable as a type of number, you MUST explicitly set it to a value before doing any addition
  or subtraction.  So call <<set $dialog_exhaustion = 1>> BEFORE doing something like
  <<set $dialog_exhaustion = $dialog_exhaustion + 1>>.  Otherwise you'll get a NaN error as Javascript has no idea how to
  add X to nothingness.sample

  Supported message functions:
  - <<set_background 1>> -- Set the background to opacity to 0, 1 or 2
